        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p>    
            Eggs are extremely versatile and you can use them to cook a variety of dishes. Today we will be making a <strong>Cheese Omelette</strong>. While cooking, it is important to keep the temperature on the low side so as to not overcook the Omelette. Let's Start! 
        </p>
        
        <h4> Ingredients </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Large Eggs</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon Milk, or as needed</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons Butter</li>
            <li>Cheese, whichever one you like</li>
            <li>Freshly cut Onion and Tomato</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk eggs in a bowl; add milk and season with salt and white pepper. Whisk until egg mixture is foamy, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            
            <li>Melt butter in a small, nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Pour in egg mixture and swirl the skillet, so the bottom is evenly covered with egg. Cook until egg starts to set, about 1 minute. Lift edges with a spatula and tilt the skillet so uncooked egg can flow towards the bottom of the skillet to set. Repeat until no visible liquid egg remains.</li>
            
            <li>Carefully flip omelette; cook until warmed through, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Sprinkle Emmentaler cheese down the middle of omelette; fold in half. Cook until cheese is melted, about 20 seconds. Slide omelette onto a plate.</li>
        </ol>
